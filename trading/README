As i didn't get any call for doubt clarification as requested, i have made some of the assumptions.
   -> Order priority was concerned first with price, then time
   -> order ids are auto generated values
   -> As third API was to get orders submitted by user, i assumed the all orders as i haven't maintained any users table
        and no track of which user submitted the order in the sample inputs

1. Created API to submit order with the fields specified in specification file
    Curl command for same
    curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8080/api/v1/order' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data-raw '{
        "orderType":"sell",
        "name":"BTC",
        "quantity":70,
        "price":242.70
    }'

2. Written the transactions as soon as they happen into file transactions.txt
3. Created another api to get the submitted orders
    curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:8080/api/v1/order' \
    --data-raw ''

Observation: For the orders given in input file, it looks two more transactions possible as we place last order
